## Run Frontend Server
To run the front end server on your computer you will need to enter the minerva-referral directory and start the server. You do not need a virtual environment to be activated.
This will run the front end branch as the developer describes it, however, you will not be able to submit any information without creating a proxy error which will be seen in the terminal. 


Start the server by running:

    $ cd minerva-referral
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start

Now you can access the rendered pages in your browser using

    $ localhost:3000


## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests use the following commands:

    $ yarn test

The test suites will be run automatically and the processes should be displayed in the command line interface along with the results.
